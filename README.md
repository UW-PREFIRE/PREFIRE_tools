# PREFIRE_tools

A relatively small collection of diverse software, primarily containing items that are (or can be) shared by multiple PREFIRE data processing algorithms.  This includes bits of software useful in the creation, processing, and analysis of PREFIRE-related data.

This is not a standalone PREFIRE data processing algorithm, and will not be archived as one.  Instead, the appropriate version of this repository will be part of the long-term archival file created for each relevant standalone processing algorithm.

This repository currently contains Python and MATLAB code, and is released under the terms of this [LICENSE](LICENSE).

_The creation of much of this code was supported by NASA, as part of the PREFIRE (Polar Radiant Energy in the Far-InfraRed Experiment) CubeSat mission._
